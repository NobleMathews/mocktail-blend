## Datasets
### Method Naming
* Download and create raw datasets using [this](./scripts/clone_repos.py) script.
* Download the processed datasets from [here](https://archive.org/details/mocktail-dataset-method-naming-tse). Processed datasets are path-extracted versions of the raw datasets. They can be readily used to train the model.

### Program Classification and Clone Detection
* Download the raw datasets from CodeXGlue's [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/Clone-detection-POJ-104#dataset).
* Download the processed datasets from [here](https://archive.org/details/mocktail-dataset-program-classification-tse). Processed datasets are path-extracted versions of the raw datasets. They can be readily used to train the model.
